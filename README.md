# rapht v0.0.1

2D graphs in a compact and intuitive package.

**NOTE:** This package relies on my fork of [umbrella](https://github.com/aleclarson/umbrella) (a jQuery alternative). You'll want to fork this package and remove that dependency if you don't want to use `umbrella` for your application.
